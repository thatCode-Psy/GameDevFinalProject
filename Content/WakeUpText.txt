[Protag bolts upright, there is an alarm clock going off in the background]

Protag (Breathing heavily, thinking to self): I woke up feeling exhausted, but that's nothing new.
	I keep having the same nightmare, almost every night.
	It's the same thing every time, as much as I wish I could change what happened.
	Again, I spent too much time just trying to shake off those awful feelings...
	I'm going to be late to class if I don't hurry.

[Protag gets up from the bed, standing upright in his simple bedroom]
