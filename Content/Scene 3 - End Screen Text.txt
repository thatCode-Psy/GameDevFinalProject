Win: 
I got to the bus stop on time and got to class today, but one of these days, I'm going to end up late for class again. 


Loss:
I missed the bus and got to class horribly late once again. My professor wasn't happy, and I have no idea how to explain to him what's been happening.


Hit by car:
I got distracted while in the middle of the road and the next thing I knew, I woke up in a hospital bed. The nurse told me that I got hit by a car.
