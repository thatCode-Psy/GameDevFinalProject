[The player is a child in their bedroom, facing away from the door out to the hall. The room has a bed with a plain set of sheets and a stuffed bear on it. Next to the bed is a small
nightstand with a lamp and a photo of a young couple, smiling. There is also a toybox with a small amount of simple toys. The player hears glass break in the distance behind them.
The player is now free to explore the room as stomping footsteps approach the room.]

Interaction Text: 

Bear - My stuffed bear, Teddy. Dad eventually tore him open and threw him in the trash.

Wall - Dad's favorite color. I can't stand to look at it.

Toy Car - A toy car. Unfortunately for me, they are very popular.

Broken Bottle - My father was a drinker as long as I could remember. He sometimes threw bottles in anger in my room and just left them there.



[After one minute, the footsteps stop, and the door into the room slams open, revealing a slightly older,
tubbier and more dirty version of the man in the photo. He turns toward the player as the player's camera turns to face him. He starts to approach.]

Father (Reaching out to grab at the player): You're the reason she's dead, you stupid leech!

[The man grabs the player, throwing them to the ground.]
