[The player is a child in their bedroom, facing away from the door out to the hall. The room has a bed with a plain set of sheets and a stuffed bear on it. Next to the bed is a small
nightstand with a lamp and a photo of a young couple, smiling. There is also a toybox with a small amount of simple toys. The player hears glass break in the distance behind them.
The player is now free to explore the room as stomping footsteps approach the room. After one minute, the footsteps stop, and the door into the room slams open, revealing a slightly older,
tubbier and more dirty version of the man in the photo. He turns toward the player as the player's camera turns to face him. He starts to approach.]

Father (Reaching out to grab at the player): You're the reason she's dead, you stupid leech!

[The man grabs the player, throwing them to the ground.]
