[Protag bolts upright, there is an alarm clock going off in the background]

Protag (Breathing heavily, thinking to self):
	I keep having the same nightmare almost every night.
	It's the same thing every time, as much as I wish I could change what happened.
	So many things remind me of my past.
	I can't bear to look at them.

[Protag gets up from the bed, standing upright in his simple bedroom,can then walk outside.]
